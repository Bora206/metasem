Description: The metaSEM package conducts univariate and multivariate
             meta-analyses using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach
             via the OpenMx package. It also implements the two-stage SEM approach
             to conducting meta-analytic structural equation modeling on a pool of
             correlation/covariance matrices.
