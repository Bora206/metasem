Description: The metaSEM package conducts univariate and multivariate meta-analyses using 
             a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach via the OpenMx package. 
             It also implements the two-stage SEM approach to conduct meta-analytic 
             structural equation modeling on correlation/covariance matrices.
